Vulkan compute shader version of Ray tracing in one weekend

Just experimenting with Vulkan compute shader & basic ray tracing.

Roughly following the tutorial "Ray tracing in 1 weekend" at https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

Use at own risk, don't blame me if it breaks something!

Visual Studio 2019 c++
GLFW window interface.
